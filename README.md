# Figma is temporary. DOOM IS ETERNAL

Generates a base Figma App with a simple port to a Doom emulator. I wanted to learn how to make a figma plugin, so I created a boilerplate in React/Redux/Typescript. If you have any questions @ me on twitter: [caseofbase87](hhttps://twitter.com/caseofbase87)

**To build**
`npm install`
`npx webpack`

**To run in Figma**
- Go to the plugins page in Figma, on the right side go to development
- Click on the +, and link existing plugin by uploading the manifest.json file
- Open up a Figma document, in the menu select Plugins / Development / Doom React Redux

**To play DOOM**
- When the window loads, click inside the window so the keys are registered when the game loads
- Move around with the arrow keys
- Shoot with Control
- Open doors / switches with space bar
